# Numerical Methods - EPGE 2022

Doing economics with pencil and paper has its limits. It is often hard of
impossible to get closed form solutions for some economic models. Therefore, numerical methods become key. With constant computational advances,
economists can deal with ever more complex models. This is the focus of this
course. The methods we will cover here are often used in macroeconomics,
but also in structural econometrics, industrial organization, etc.

Here are some of the topics we will cover in the course:

- Value function iteration (VFI)
- Projection methods
- Root-finding, interpolation, discretization of stochastic processes
- Computing stationary distributions
- Models with heterogeneous agents with idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks
- Calibration and estimation methods via simulation
- Solution of models in continuous time
